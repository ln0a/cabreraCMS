<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>New 10-unit live/work community to serve as a catalyst for Core City. Internationally acclaimed and awarded. Completed May 2017.</p>
<h2>STORY</h2>
<p>I began to write the story of True North, it started like this:</p>
<p><em>True North, a project of firsts: first new construction project in Core City since the 1960s; first ground-up residential project for Prince Concepts; first non-military Quonset Hut community; first step towards activating one of Detroit’s quiet, spacious, and uniquely beautiful neighborhoods.</em></p>
<p><em>After the fast success of KATOI, Prince Concepts set its sight on developing Core City, more specifically, the intersection of Grand River and Warren. True North sits one block SW of this intersection, where Prince Concepts had assembled four buildings and about four acres of land when the idea of True North landed in the mind of Philip Kafka during the fall of 2015.</em></p>
<p>I stopped. Accurate information, but words - like a project - must reach. They must do what they describe justice, and aspire to be more than what’s expected.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to do True North justice. How do you tell the story of a beginning? How do you look back at a project that spurred a career, the development of an entire neighborhood, set a new precedent and describe how it came to be, how it went, and what it is in just a few paragraphs?</p>
<p><em>Lets try.</em></p>
<p>True North began when Kafka, a student of World War II, saw a photograph of an American Army base outside of Berlin at the end of WWII (image in artifacts folder). The base was built with Quonset huts. It looked tough and utilitarian, but also like a ripe environment for creativity, collaboration and community. It was implied that huts were cheap and fast to build, the challenge would be to figure out how to make them beautiful, too/</p>
<p>Kafka began interviewing architects and decided to work with EC3, directed by Edwin Chan. Chan, formerly the design director for Gehry Partners, had led the designs of the museum projects for that office. Kafka decided on Chan because of his energy, sensitivity, curiosity, and his desire to take on the challenge of creating museum quality spaces (indoor and outdoor) with the Quonset Hut.</p>
<p>During construction, Kafka lived on site in the STUDY and served as the contractor (with no prior experience, another first) and project manager. He assembled a motley crew of 15 labourers and they began piecing the project together, art more than science with a good mix of the two. Many of the design decisions were made by Kafka and Chan - on site and over the phone - as Kafka reported the strengths of the crew, and opportunities with regard to the cost of certain materials.</p>
<p>When we broke ground on True North, there were just six occupied homes within a ten block radius of the project. The neighborhood was extremely vacant. In the idea section, below, we will discuss how we addressed injecting a “different blood type” into a spacious, but old and sparsely occupied neighbourhood.</p>
<p>It took just nine months to complete True North, and the ten units had a waiting list of over 400 people.</p>
<p>True North was named Multi-Family development of the year by Architect’s Newspaper (2017); runner-up was a 500 million dollar project in Manhattan, the American Copper Building. True North was also a winner of a progressive architecture award, and was featured on the cover of Architect Magazine in February of 2018. Some of the most significant Architecture prizes during the 2017/2018 award cycle,most notably serving as one of six finalists for the enlightened Mies Crown Hall Americas Prize.</p>
<h2>IDEA</h2>
<p>The idea, contrary to what most imagine, wasn’t to use the Quonset Hut; it was, rather, to figure out how to give high quality space for a reasonable cost. This, in turn, would inspire people to go somewhere they otherwise had not considered living. Quality of the space and value we’re the benefit, as opposed to the traditional idea in real estate - location.</p>
<p>Whereas most new construction multi-family projects aim to achieve maximal density and feature amenities - in the form of location, exercise rooms, countertop materials, brand faucets and fixtures, doormen, and swimming pools. The emphasis for True North was on quality of space, simply put. The project was built for a creative lifestyle, not a luxury one.</p>
<p>Understanding that this project would be exotic within the existing neighborhood, and most likely invite resident who were of a different demographic.</p>
