## SUMMARY

Prince Concepts is a real estate development and property management company located in Core City, Detroit.
Since 2012, Prince Concepts has acquired and owns seventeen acres of land, renovated 62,000 square feet of formerly blighted industrial property, imagined and built 20,000 SF of new housing, created 15,000 SF of thoughtful public space, planted over 300 trees, and won nine national and international awards for its completed projects.


## STORY

The vast majority of this development has taken place, and will continue to be, in Core City. We believe that consistent, dedicated, and focused work within a specific area is how the unique character and value within the Detroit neighborhoods comes to life.

Creating inspired space is the objective of our work, making such space accessible is our aspiration and the real work of our work. We aim to offer our tenants, our neighborhood, and Detroit public and private spaces of note. Our belief is that living in and around architecture - both natural and man made - offers humans immense benefits.
You can learn more about our completed projects in the WORK section of this website.
Prince Concepts is directed by Philip Kafka.
